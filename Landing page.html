    <u><h1><Em><strong>Profile</strong></Em></h1></u>
    <p>I'm a highly driven, determined and dedicated individual, with a demonstrated ability to
design, develop and implement solutions that meets employer and client needs. I firmly
believe that my ability to work  cohesively within a team and to build strong work relationships
are among my most valuable traits and have served me well in my career.
    </p>
    <p>My technical experience includes building investment calculators and tools using VBA and
      more recently, Python. I also have experience using SQL to source data and perform analysis
      which included in marketing documents and presentations.
    </p>
    <p>My non-technical experience includes communications in the form of responses to technical
      adviser queries, presenting to a large group of financial advisers, educating call center teams
      and providing necessary information to respond to client and adviser queries.</p>
